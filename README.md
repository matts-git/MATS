# MATS

Mathematical Acuity Testing System (MATS).

MATS is a math quiz game which allows the user to set parameters for their testing through a JavaFX GUI menu. Answers are input into the console.

Scores are weighted on chosen difficulty and time taken to answer. Score records are tracked for individual users using a database system, and high score records are reported upon acheivement.

The MATS program is multi-threaded to allow for exact determination of answer times.

Difficulty scales quickly, so please start off at a low difficulty and work your way up.

# Requirements

MATS requires JavaFX. All other dependencies are provided for in the POM.

# Project Template
